        <h2> About the Project</h2>
        <img src="images/CAB.jpg" alt="CAB Group Photo" id="cabimg" class="cabimg" width="400" height="250">
        <p>This project is a labor of love for the community and love for more efficient processes.
            Several Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) and Anchor Organizations own various
            items and occasionally lend them
            to other student and faculty-led organizations on campus.
            In doing so, many organizations create an extra, manual task for their operational positions.
            A lack of automation often results in errors from item ownership expectations to
            miscommunication for item pickup and drop off to missed email communications, and more.
            The goal of the Activities Inventory Management System (AIMS) project is to
            create an automated process that decreases repetitive, manual tasks and frequent inaccuracies.</p>
